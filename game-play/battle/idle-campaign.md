# IDLE Campaign

IDLE CAMPAIGN is an activity in which players may collect materials to utilize the power of each of their Elemons when joining PVE without having to spend too much time online.  


After waiting for the maximum AFK duration of 12 hours, the player will be awarded with \(x\)% additional resources \(with a rare chance of getting universal stone\).   


Rewards are calculated by the minute, players can obtain resources including character exp, Elemon exp, skill exp card, â€¦  


Players are allowed to replay the previous maps, but the reward will be less.  


Players use energy points \(Energy\) to participate in this activity.
