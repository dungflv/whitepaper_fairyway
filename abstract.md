# Abstract

Cryptocurrencies, notably their valuations and potential to disrupt the banking and financial system as it is, are gaining popularity as blockchain technology continues to dominate headlines. Equally is NFT which has garnered attention and caused echoing waves in recent times.

The regular consumer, on the other hand, has no idea what cryptocurrency/NFT is or why they matter, let alone how the technology that powers it work.

The video game industry \(and also NFT use\) has quickly become one of the main drivers of blockchain adoption among the general public. Many giants of the gaming world have understood this well and are investing colossal sums in the development of video games based on the blockchain or features taking advantage of this technology. From now and years to come, the blockchain and its countless possibilities are promised to invade the daily lives of gamers.

This is why Elemon has found a way to combine the blockchain-based gaming world and NFT in a next-generation concept and created an universe of unique digital creatures.

The future of blockchain video games will first come through Non-Fungible Tokens \(NFTs\). Concretely, these tokens are unique, identifiable tokens capable of representing virtual assets.

Elemon will make blockchain technology accessible to common consumers via these strategies;

·      Tokenization of digital creatures.

·      Play-to-earn concept.

·      A friendly, consumer-based concept with a real passion for blockchain technology.

·      An open platform that welcomes users with varying levels of technical expertise.

·      A revenue-based paradigm that can be sustained with ELMON value inflation limitation.

In more technical terms, we plan to revolutionize the blockchain world by putting digital collectibles, digital scarcity, and non-fungible tokens to practical use in the video game world. By doing this, more and more average consumers are empowered with the knowledge of how distributed ledger technology really works. People can see how the evolutionary blockchain industry can be made use of outside of the financial niche.Please keep in mind that this whitepaper is intended solely for informational purposes and does not and will not impose any legally binding obligations on the authors or any third parties.
