# Our Motivation and Why?

  
The Game industry \(and also NFT use\) has quickly become one of the main drivers of blockchain adoption among the general public. Many giants of the gaming world have understood this well and are investing colossal sums in the development of video games based on the blockchain or features taking advantage of this technology. From now and years to come, the blockchain and its countless possibilities promise to invade the daily lives of gamers.

‌\[Abstract\] The phenomenal success of the Pokémon Go game developed by Nintendo that made augmented reality a part of the daily lives of millions of people also inspired the development of this revolutionary blockchain project.

‌Fairyway’s mission is to build an integrated digital platform of tokenized monsters that appeals to the average consumer as they can participate and make a profit while actively using Blockchain technology. This is why Fairyway has found a way to combine the blockchain-based gaming world and NFT in a next-generation concept and created a digital platform universe of unique digital creatures.

‌

The future of blockchain games will first come through Non-Fungible Tokens \(NFTs\).
